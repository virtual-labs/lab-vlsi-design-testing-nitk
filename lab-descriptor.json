  "introduction": "The VLSI Design Testing Laboratory is designed to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in the domain of Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. Through a series of practical experiments, students will engage in designing, verifying, and testing a variety of VLSI circuits used in digital systems. These include applications such as ODD/EVEN parity generators, BCD-to-excess-3 code converters, and priority encoders. The lab also incorporates virtual simulations to help students build a strong foundation in both basic and advanced concepts of chip design and verification, thereby enhancing their comprehension of real-world VLSI applications.",
